## Background
Large brain age models, trained to predict chronological age from brain MRI, are widely used as markers of general brain health. However, it is unclear whether these models can effectively predict specific outcomes like Alzheimer's Disease (AD) classification or Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) progression. In this work, we compare a state-of-the-art pretrained brain age model (Leonardsen et al., 2022) against models trained directly on AD-related outcomes using T1 MRI from ADNI, AIBL, and MACC Harmonization Cohort datasets. We find that direct models consistently match or outperform brain age models. These results suggest that using chronological age as a pretraining target might be suboptimal for predicting specific health outcomes.
